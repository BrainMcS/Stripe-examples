Questions/exercise

Question paymentintent:
"Implement a payment intent in Stripe, following REST principles."

Question api:
"Implement a Python script that uses Stripe's API to create a customer, add a payment method, and create a subscription to a specific price. Handle potential errors appropriately."

Question datatransformation:
"A client has sent you a CSV file containing customer information and their subscription details. Write a script to import this data into Stripe, creating customers and subscriptions as appropriate. The CSV has columns: customer_name, email, plan_name, monthly_amount, and start_date."

Question createwebhook:
"Implement a simple webhook handler for Stripe events that listens for 'charge.succeeded' and 'invoice.payment_failed' events. When a charge succeeds, send a confirmation email to the customer. When a payment fails, alert the customer and update a database record."

Question ratelimiter:
"Design a rate limiter for Stripe API requests that allows 100 requests per minute per API key. Implement this in Python with appropriate error handling."

Question parsewebhooklog:
"Implement a script that can parse a Stripe webhook log file and produce a report of successful vs. failed payments. The log file contains one JSON object per line, each representing a webhook event."

Question subsmanagmentsystem:
"Design a simple subscription management system that handles Stripe payment methods, subscriptions, and notifications for upcoming renewals. No need to implement the full system, but provide the key components and data structures."

Question automation:
"Create a script that automatically checks for upcoming invoices in the next 7 days and sends reminder emails to customers. The script should handle pagination of Stripe API results and include proper error handling."

Question authcheck:
"Implement a simple client for Stripe's OAuth flow that allows users to connect their Stripe accounts to your platform. After connection, retrieve basic account information and available balance."

Question webhook2: 
"Implement a webhook receiver that verifies incoming Stripe events using the signature, then processes different event types like charge.succeeded, invoice.payment_failed, and customer.subscription.updated."

Question multiserviceintegration: 
"Create a script that syncs new user signups between a CRM system, email marketing platform, and payment processor. When a user is added to one system, ensure they are properly added to all systems with correct attributes."

Question productupload: 
"Build a solution that takes a CSV file containing product information, transforms the data into the required format, and then uploads the products to an e-commerce platform API."

Question tokenmanagementsystem: 
"Implement a token management system that handles OAuth authentication for multiple services, including obtaining initial tokens, refreshing expired tokens, and securely storing credentials."

Question listener: 
"Design a system that listens for specific events from one API and triggers appropriate actions in another service. For example, when a new order is created in a shopping cart, create a shipping label via a logistics API."

Question ratelimiter2: 
"Implement a class that manages API request rate limiting using a token bucket algorithm to ensure applications don't exceed API quotas."

Question loganalysis: 
"Create a script that analyzes API error logs, identifies the most common error patterns, and generates a summary report with recommendations."

Question datapipelineJSON: 
"Build a data pipeline that takes JSON data with nested structures, flattens it, transforms specific fields, and outputs the result in a different format."

Question batchandpaginate: 
"Write a utility that handles processing large datasets by implementing batching and pagination when making API calls, with proper error handling and retry logic."

Question reconcile: 
"Create a script that compares transaction data between two systems (e.g., your database and a payment processor) and identifies discrepancies."

Question currencyexchange: 
"Python implementation for multi-currency handling in a payment system. This example will cover the three main implementation approaches.
Single merchant account with conversion:
      * Simple but exposes to forex fees
      * Currency converted at processor
 Multiple currency accounts:
      * Account for each currency
      * No conversion for major currencies
      * More complex setup and reconciliation
Third-party forex service:
      * Specialized conversion handling
      * May offer better rates
      * Additional integration required
"

Question factorypattern: 
"Create a robust Factory Pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes for payment methods."

Question factorypattern: 
"Create a robust The Observer Pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object triggers updates in dependent objects for certain actions."

Question circuitbreaker: 
"Create Circuit Breaker Pattern prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services."

Question idempotency:
"Create Idempotency that ensures operations can be safely retried without causing duplicate effects for a payment processor action."

Question retrypattern:
"Create the Retry Pattern where it is essential for robust API interactions, especially in distributed systems where transient failures are common."

Question webhookverification:
"
Webhook Verification System
Implementation Approach:
   Parse incoming webhook payload and headers
   Extract signature from appropriate header
   Retrieve webhook secret from secure storage
   Compute HMAC signature using payload and secret
   Compare computed signature with received signature
   Process webhook only if signature is valid
Best Practices:
   Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
   Implement replay protection with timestamp validation
   Return 200 OK quickly, process asynchronously if needed
   Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhooks
"
Question api_payment_intent:
Build a program that interacts with a payment API to:
- Create a payment intent for a specified amount and currency
- Retrieve the status of a payment
- List transactions within a date range
- Handle webhook notifications for payment events

Question api_errorhandling:
Write a robust client that interacts with an API that occasionally experiences downtime:
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Handle various HTTP error codes appropriately
- Log failures and successful retries
- Ensure TLS errors are properly detected and reported

Question api_datatransformation:
Fetch transaction data from an API and transform it:
- Group transactions by categories
- Calculate summary statistics (totals, averages)
- Generate a report in a specific format (JSON, CSV)
- Handle pagination to retrieve complete datasets

Question api_troubleshootingconnectivity:
Debug and fix a provided code sample that's failing to connect to an API:
- Identify TLS/certificate issues
- Fix authentication problems
- Resolve incorrect request formatting
- Implement proper error handling

Question api_webhook:
Create a system to:
- Verify incoming webhook signatures
- Process different event types
- Store relevant event data
- Trigger appropriate actions based on event type

Question api_ratelimit:
Build a client that respects API rate limits:
- Parse rate limit headers
- Implement a request queue
- Add delays when approaching limits
- Prioritize certain types of requests

Question api_datasync:
Write a program that:
- Fetches customer data from one API
- Updates customer profiles in another system
- Identifies and resolves conflicts
- Reports on synchronization status

Question api_refundcapabilityextension:
- Add refund method

Question api_addwebhook:
Our payment processing system currently receives webhook events but doesn't verify their authenticity. Extend the existing webhook handler to verify webhook signatures using Stripe's signature verification approach

Question api_addpagination:
Our API client can fetch customers but doesn't support pagination. Extend the client to fetch all customers by handling pagination correctly.

Question api_addACHpayment:
Our payment processor currently supports credit cards only. Extend it to support ACH bank transfers as well.

Question api_addretry:
Our API client doesn't handle transient network errors well. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for all API calls.
